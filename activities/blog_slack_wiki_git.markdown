# Blog/Ed/Wiki/GitHub/Wikipedia/OpenStreetMap Activity

## Introduction

 Professional and open source software development makes use of many different communication channels, each with its own strengths and purpose.
 We will be making use of several such communication channels (blogs, Ed discussion forum, course wiki, GitHub organization) in this class and many of you will find yourselves also using others (IRC/Gitter/Discord/etc.) as they apply to your selected projects.

 You will also be contributing to projects hosted on several sites: GtiHub, Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap  and others as they apply to your selected projects.

 The start of the semester is a good time to get organized and setup access to some of these platforms. It is also the time to share the information 
 about your usernames and accounts with the rest of the class, since we will be keeping an eye on your activities. 


## GitHub

 The course organization is hosted on GitHub. It is also likely that you will pick a project
 that hosts its repositories on GitHub. (It is possible that you will work on a
 	project that uses a different hosting site. In such a case, you will need to setup
 	an account there as well, eventually.)
    
After you complete this task, share your GitHub username with the instructors by completing the survey form shared on the course website. 

 **Tasks**

Most of you have an existing GitHub account. But if you do not, or if you do not wish to use it for the class purpose, you should create a new one.

 1. Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/).
 2. In the upper right corner click the Sign Up button.
 3. In the page that opens, complete the information required by GitHub.
 If you do not wish the user name to be easily associated with you, pick something that is not related to your name or your netID.



## Blog

 You will be using a blog to post weekly writings reflecting on the reading and discussion topic for the week.

 **Tasks:**

Setup your blog site (this can only be done AFTER you shared your GitHub username with your instructor and you were added to the course organization):
- locate your repository in the class organization, it should be called __YOUR_USERNAME-weekly__
- edit the `_config.yml` file and make changes indicated by the comments
- edit the `about.md` file to include some information about yourself
 (make sure that you are using markdown to format this page)

Note: You should clone the repository to your local machine, make changes there and then push the content back to the repository on GitHub. Do not edit it directly on GitHub (if you are inclined to do this, then you do need practice on using `git` and this is a good place to start!).

You should be making your first blog post by the end of the first week of classes and then weekly throughout the semester.

## Slack

Slack is "A messaging app for teams". Slack helps teams working on projects to do all communications within a single app rather than spreading information across e-mail, im, texts, etc. Everything posted on Slack is indexed and searchable, making it easy to go back and find information and resources or reconstruct ideas and processes.

 **Tasks:**

 1.  Skim over the [What is Slack?](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004071768-What-is-Slack-) page to familiarize yourself with the Slack Basics. You don't have to get everything... just get the idea.
 2.  Use this link [nyuossd.slack.com/signup](https://join.slack.com/t/cs-2sr2399/shared_invite/zt-12cw2ik8m-tWRCYB5OIOoObEVUi~Bueg) to sign up directly for our course Slack Workspace.
 3.  [Edit Your Profile](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204092246-Edit-your-profile) to include at least your first and last name. You can also upload a photo or avatar if you'd like.
 4.  Skim over the links in the [Work in Channels Topic](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/200111606) page
 5.   Skim over the links in the [Send Messages Topic](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/200111606#send-messages) do the following:
     -   Post a message to the #general channel.
     -   Edit the message you just posted.
     -   Star the #course channel and note where your starred channels appear.
     -   Star a message in the #general channel and note where your starred messages appear.
     -   Add a reaction to a message in the #general channel.
     -   Team up with a classmate or two:
         -   Mention another member in a message in the #general channel.
         -   Find the list of your mentions and reactions.
         -   Send a direct message to someone.
         -   Reply to a direct message from someone.

## Ed discussion forum

Some of you might be familiar with Ed from other classes. We will be using Ed for all class communications. Some of the course activities will require 
you to post updates on Ed. 

 **Tasks:**

 1.  Make sure that you can access this course on Ed. 


## Wikipedia

We will spend some time editing Wikipedia pages, and while an account is not
absolutely necessary for this, I am requiring that you create one so that we can easily track your contributions.
These are instructions for creating an account in Wikipedia.

**Tasks**

1. Visit [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)
2. In the upper right corner, click the Create Account link.
3. Complete the information required on the page that loads. It is very self-explanatory. If you do not wish the user name to be easily associated with you, pick something that is not related to your name or your netID.


## Open Street Map

We will also spend some time editing the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), so you need to create an account on that site as well.

**Tasks**

1. Visit the page [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).
2. In the upper right corner click the Sign Up button.
3. In the page that opens, complete the information required by OpenStreetMap.
If you do not wish the user name to be easily associated with you, pick something that is not related to your name or your netID.


## Course Wiki

The course [organization on GitHub](https://github.com/ossd-s25) contains a private repository called wiki. 
The repository will remain empty throughtout the semester, but we will be using [__its Wiki__ pages](https://github.com/ossd-s25/wiki/wiki). 
We will use this for content that needs to be jointly edited by everybody in the class. All of you should have write access to the existing pages and permission to create new pages.

This is a private wiki, so only people in the class have access to it.

**Tasks**

Go to the existing page called _OSSD participants_ and edit it to add your name and some information about you (use my entry as a template). You should list:
- your name,
- link to your blog (the actual blog page, not the repository),
- link to your GitHub profile
- your Wikipedia username with a link to __your contributions page__
- your OpenStreetMap username  with a link to __your contributions page__ 
- the name (and a link) of your favorite open source project (challenge: pick
  a project that nobody else listed; you can list more than one) - this should be a project that you are at least somewhat familiar with, so spend some time figuring out what you want it to be (do not just search the web and use the first project that comes up) 

  Follow the formatting in my entry! (and use it as a guide for markdown if you are not familiar with markdown yet).

NOTE: With our Wiki anyone can edit any page. This is great for collaborative creation of the pages, but it also comes with great responsibility. Please do not edit anyone else's personal entries. Keep in mind that the software logs all changes and the user that makes them (just have a look at the "History" tab). 

NOTE 2: Historically, the biggest challenge for this last step was to keep the entries organized alphabetically by last name! Let's see how it goes this term &#128512;.
